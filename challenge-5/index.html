        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The following are the snippets for challenge 5.<br>
            Definitely learned a ton with this one. Initially the api was
            somewhat the main focus, but as usual, styling did take up more time.<br>
            Cool that we were able to implement a dynamic element to this challenge.

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            For the HTML, I really focused on keeping my as simple as possible. I always feel like there can be some improvement, but specifically focused on my BEM being correct and HTML standards.<br>
            Really don't have much to complain about this portain, and only messed with the HTML when I decided to add and accommodate this code snippet portion of the challenge. Ultimately settled on adding my personal notes here to simulate a blog post.

        <h3>SCSS</h3>
        <p>
            Per usual, styling is the once facet of web development that gives me a hard time. I have to admit that I spent about 80% of this project focusing on styling.<br>
            It went beyond getting it styled correctly, but making sure that I refactored to trim the fat and DRY my styling sheet. It was an excercise to go back and ask myself over and over "What can I remove, and how can I simplify this?"<br>
            Feel like I was able to achieve that (based on what it looked like in it's first iteration), and open to understand how I can help simplify it even further.

        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            Gotta admit, this was fun. We haven't messed with JS (at least not required to), and I was pumped to get to implement this api.<br>
            Simply put, I was able to refer to the Javascript Fetch API and lean on it to complete this project.<br>
            Added the alert window as a extra bonus to enhance user exprience, but need to cache the session, because it can get annoying to see the pop-up window everytime the page loads. But my thought process was to alert an anonymous user to click on the dice to receive a new advice.
